## 🎯 Overview

This repository tracks my journey building a comprehensive portfolio of quantitative finance projects. My goal is to develop **production-quality implementations** across trading systems, derivatives pricing, and quantitative research that demonstrate skills valuable for Quant Developer, Quant Researcher, and Technical Analyst roles.

### Current Focus (Winter 2025)
- 📚 Taking **FINM 33150** - Quantitative Trading Strategies at UChicago
- 💼 Working as **Quantitative Developer** at 7 Chord Inc. (fixed income analytics)
- 🚀 Building systematic trading infrastructure and derivatives pricing libraries

## 📊 Portfolio Status

**Target:** 6-7 high-quality GitHub projects by Summer 2025

### ✅ Completed Projects
1. **[Event-Driven Trading System](https://github.com/dafu-zhu/event-driven-trading)** (Python)
   - Event-driven architecture with backtesting/live execution
   - Order book simulation, risk management, PostgreSQL persistence

2. **[Auto Alpha Mining Infrastructure](https://github.com/dafu-zhu/alpha-mining)** (Python/ML)
   - Reinforcement learning for alpha generation (500+ candidates/hour)
   - FastAPI microservice deployed on AWS EC2

### 🚧 In Progress
3. **Multi-Asset Strategy Library** (Python) - Winter 2025
   - Building from FINM 33150 course assignments
   - Cross-asset trading strategies with unified backtesting framework

### 📋 Planned Projects

**Spring 2025:**
4. **Interest Rate Derivatives Engine** (C++/Python)
   - Curve bootstrapping, Hull-White calibration, Bermudan swaptions
   - Production C++ library with Python bindings

5. **FINM 33150 Final Project** (C++/Python)
   - High-performance system showcasing C++ proficiency (TBD Week 5-6)

**Summer 2025:**
6. **Enhanced DCAM Factor Model** (Python)
   - Deep dive into previous internship project with ML extensions
   - Complete reimplementation with US market data

7. **Options Analytics Library** (C++/Python)
   - Black-Scholes, implied volatility surface, local volatility
   - Numerical Greeks and arbitrage detection

## 🎓 Skills Demonstrated

### Languages & Tools
- **Production Code:** C++ (Eigen, pybind11), Python (NumPy, Polars, PyTorch)
- **Systems:** Docker, AWS, Git, CI/CD, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Finance:** QuantLib, derivatives pricing, backtesting frameworks

### Domain Knowledge
- **Fixed Income:** Curve construction, bond analytics (7 Chord experience)
- **Equities:** Factor models, systematic strategies, alpha mining
- **Derivatives:** Options, interest rate products, exotic pricing
- **Trading Systems:** Event-driven architecture, order management, risk controls

### Technical Depth
- Production-quality architecture (not just research notebooks)
- Cross-asset class implementations
- Performance optimization (C++ for speed, Python for flexibility)

## 🎯 Career Strategy

**Philosophy:** Apply broadly to QR/QD/Analyst roles while building deep technical coding skills that create competitive advantage across all quantitative finance positions.

**Why This Approach:**
- First job is about **learning and credibility**, not locking into 10-year path
- Heavy coding addresses my **weakness** → creates differentiation
- Production-quality projects demonstrate **systems thinking** valued everywhere
- Cross-asset knowledge avoids **premature specialization**

Each project is frameable for multiple role types:
- **QR framing:** Research infrastructure, strategy validation
- **QD framing:** Production systems, performance optimization  
- **Analyst framing:** Analytics tools, automation frameworks
